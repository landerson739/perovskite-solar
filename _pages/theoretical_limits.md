## What is Efficiency?

The efficiency of any electrical device is defined by the ratio between the useful work produced by the total energy consumed. Efficiency is often denoted by the symbol Î·.

For example, a lightbulb is designed to emit light by consuming electrical power.

Incandescent lightbulbs are considered to be inefficient devices as they produce very little light for the amount of power they consume. A lot of the power consumed is wasted a heat.

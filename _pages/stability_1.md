## Electrical Instability
##### Anomalous Hysteresis

Hysteresis is simply the dependency of a state of a system on its history. For elastic bands, a hysteresis curve can be seen from its force against extensions plot, as seen in Fig. 1. Here, the relationship between the extension of the band and the force applied to it is effected by whether a load is being applied to the band, or if one is being taken off. In the case of perovskite solar cell, this hysteresis effect is seen from the current-voltage plots. Depending on the bias direction, (whether or not the current-voltage sweep is being measured from forward to reverse bias or the other way round), different measurements are obtained in measuring efficiencies. Moreover, the scan rate of the measurements seemingly has an effect on the observed hysteresis for the device, with a slower scan rate achieving a lesser hysteresis effect. Whilst not inherently degrading the solar cell, this phenomenon leads to complications in regards to the potential applications of perovskite solar cells. During real operating conditions, the maximum power point will vary throughout the day, as a results a precise measurement into the efficiencies of the performing cell will be unknown. In order to address this issue, the precise origins of the hysteresis effect within perovskite solar cells need to be understood, and what this can tell us about the electrical properties of the material.

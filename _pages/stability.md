# Introduction
In recent years the conversion efficiencies of perovskite-based solar cells have seen an unprecedented rise. With their ability to undergo flexible applications due to their thin and lightweight structures, along with their relatively cheap production through low-cost materials, the potential viability and future mass production of perovskite solar cells has gained great interest over the last 10 years.
This rise in performance however has not been met with structural integrity and practical applications. Whilst theoretical approximations and calculations into the conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells are important, the most crucial aspect of any solar cell is their ability to withstand realistic operating conditions. These include, however are not limited to; long term exposure from electrical biasing, light, heat, humidity and UV radiation.
In this section, the most pressing concerns regarding the long term stability of perovskite-based solar cells are explored. Potential solutions to these problems are discussed, as well as what this can tell us about the innate property of perovskites themselves.  


#### Anomalous hysteresis 
Hysteresis is simply the dependancy of a state of a system on its history. For elastic bands, a hysteresis curve can be seen from its force against extensions plot, with their being a dependancy on whether or not the band had previously been extended or not. In the case of perovskite solar cell, this hysteresis effect is seen from the current-voltage plots.
Depending on the bias direction, (whether or not the current-voltage sweep is being measured from forward to reverse bias or the other way round), different results are obtained.

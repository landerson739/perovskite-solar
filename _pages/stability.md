# Introduction
In recent years the conversion efficiencies of perovskite-based solar cells have seen an unprecedented rise. With their ability to undergo flexible applications due to their thin and lightweight structures, along with their relatively cheap production through low-cost materials, the potential viability and future mass production of perovskite solar cells has gained great interest over the last 10 years.
This rise in performance however has not been met with structural integrity and practical applications. Whilst theoretical approximations and calculations into the conversion efficiencies of perovskite solar cells are important, the most crucial aspect of any solar cell is their ability to withstand realistic operating conditions. These include, however are not limited to; long term exposure from electrical biasing, light, heat, humidity and UV radiation.
In this section, the most pressing concerns regarding the long term stability of perovskite-based solar cells are explored. Potential solutions to these problems are discussed, as well as what this can tell us about the innate property of perovskites themselves.  


#### Anomalous hysteresis (sub heading)
Hysteresis is simply the dependency of a state of a system on its history. For elastic bands, a hysteresis curve can be seen from its force against extensions plot, as seen in Fig. 1. Here, the relationship between the extension of the band and the force applied to it is effected by whether a load is being applied to the band, or if one is being taken off. In the case of perovskite solar cell, this hysteresis effect is seen from the current-voltage plots.
Depending on the bias direction, (whether or not the current-voltage sweep is being measured from forward to reverse bias or the other way round), different measurements are obtained in measuring efficiencies. Moreover, the scan rate of the measurements seemingly has an effect on the observed hysteresis for the device, with a slower scan rate achieving a lesser hysteresis effect.
Whilst not inherently degrading the solar cell, this phenomenon leads to complications in regards to the potential applications of perovskite solar cells. During real operating conditions, the maximum power point will vary throughout the day, as a results a precise measurement into the efficiencies of the performing cell will be unknown.
In order to address this issue, the precise origins of the hysteresis effect within perovskite solar cells need to be understood, and what this can tell us about the electrical properties of the material.
